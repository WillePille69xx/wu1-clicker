After planning and answering the questions in Answerme.md (the README document), I tried to start coding. But I didn’t like how the original HTML and CSS were written, so I decided to rewrite everything from scratch. I had a few issues aligning the upgrades and making only the upgrade container scrollable — in other words, I got stuck on something simple for way too long. All I needed to do was set the Y-axis overflow to auto.

I’ve now spent quite a lot of time working on the Mutant Chamber (still a WIP), and it’s been pretty challenging too. Might not finnish it, I mean it *alot* of extra work.
