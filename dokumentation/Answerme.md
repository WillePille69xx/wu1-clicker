# Game Name: Mutant Mayhem Clicker
You are a mad scientist in an underground lab, creating mutants through bizarre DNA experiments. The more you click, the more mutations you generate. Your ultimate goal? Build an unstoppable mutant army and take over the world!

## How Does the Game Work?
Currency: DNA fragments (gained by clicking and experimenting on lab rats and other creatures).
Objective: Create powerful mutants and gradually conquer the world. You start with small experiments and end with an apocalyptic mutant invasion.
## Upgrades
"Radiation Chambers" – Increases DNA production per click.
"Frankenstein Machine" – Combines two mutants into a stronger version.
"Nanobot Serum" – Makes mutants self-replicating, generating passive income.
"Genetic Research" – Unlocks a chance to create rare mutants with special abilities.
"Zombie Virus" – Turns normal humans into mutants, exponentially increasing production.
"Cosmic Radiation" – Unlocks interdimensional mutations.
## Achievements & Milestones
"It’s Alive!" – Create your first mutant.
"Revenge of the Lab Rats" – Experiment on 100 lab rats.
"Zombie Apocalypse" – Infect 10,000 humans with the virus.
"Catalyst of Chaos" – Create a mutant that destroys an entire city.
"God Complex" – Control 1 billion mutants.
"Is this the end?" – Destroy the world.

## Colors
Background: Dark green and black (mysterious lab, radioactive feel).
Button Colors: Neon green and purple for a toxic, glowing effect.
Text: Light green or white for contrast.

## Graphics & Visuals
Mutation Effects: Cracks in reality, pulsing organic blobs.
Mutants: From tiny, ugly blobs to grotesque monstrosities.
The Lab: Background evolves as you upgrade (starting as a small lab and growing into a chaotic, high-tech facility with broken pipes and radioactive goo).

## Fonts
Headings: Orbitron or Exo (sci-fi, futuristic look).
Body Text: Roboto or Montserrat for easy reading.

## Layout
Main Button: An experiment station in the center. (or something alike maybe a petri dish with a dna icon inside.)
DNA Counter: A clear display at the top.
Upgrades Panel: Positioned on the right, showing costs and effects.
Mutation Chamber: A section where mutants evolve and multiply.
